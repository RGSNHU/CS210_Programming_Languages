# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this Project the problem that we were trying to solve is creating a clock that is ajustable and easy for a costumer to use from any where in the world. Also creating a 24 hour clock that could be easily read so that customers wouldnt have to worry about messing up pm and am. 

# What did you do particularly well?
Personally I don't think I did anything partically well. For me I was so constrained on time that I was really just trying to get the project done. My big wish on this project was that I could have spent more time on the display portion. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think that learning more about how system commands work could help out a ton to help my code. One big thing that I wish I could have done better is consle control if you add seconds it would just keep printing more and more. If I had cleared the old text and the old clocks it would have looked a lot nicer.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skil that will be most transferable will be the object oriented programming that this project helped nail down for me. I think that being able to write your code across a header file a function file then having a clean main while that all sounds super simple, and is, it just makes the code look super clean and organized which as this projects get bigger is something that I really appreciate and can see why it is the industry standard. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Just like I said before the program is super maintainable because of the way that it got broken up. By completely seperating the functions and writing a header file I would able to organize everything, which helps with readablity and adaptablity.
